## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm 8+
- **OpenAI API key** (required) - You must obtain your own API key from [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LearningLab.git
   cd LearningLab
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install root dependencies and all workspace dependencies
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit the .env file with your OpenAI API key
   # You MUST replace 'your_openai_api_key_here' with your actual OpenAI API key
   # OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
   ```

   **⚠️ Important**: You must provide your own OpenAI API key. Get one from [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). The application will not work without a valid API key.

### Development

Start both frontend and backend in development mode:

```bash
# From the project root
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Backend server on `http://localhost:3000`
- Frontend development server on `http://localhost:5173` with hot reloading

The frontend will automatically proxy API requests to the backend.

### Production Build

```bash
# Build both frontend and backend
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

The production build will serve the React app from the Express server at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Development Workflow

- **Frontend Development**: Work in `server/client/src/`
- **Backend Development**: Work in `server/src/`
- **Shared Types**: Define in `server/src/types/` and import in the frontend
- **Environment Variables**: Configure in `.env` (root level)

### Key Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start both frontend and backend in development mode
- `npm run dev:server` - Start only the backend server
- `npm run dev:client` - Start only the frontend development server
- `npm run build` - Build both frontend and backend for production
- `npm start` - Start production server

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend

- **Node.js** with **Express**
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **OpenAI API** for AI-powered content generation
- **Environment variables** for configuration
- **RESTful API** design

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```env
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173

# Security Settings (Optional - secure defaults provided)
WORKSHEET_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=10
WORKSHEET_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=3600000
GENERAL_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
GENERAL_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
MAX_REQUEST_SIZE=1024
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your OpenAI API key secure
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- The `.env.example` file is provided as a template

### Serverless deployments (Cloudflare Pages / Vercel)

The `functions/api` (Cloudflare) and `api/` (Vercel) handlers only accept
browser requests from their own origin. To allow another site to call the API,
set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to a comma-separated list of origins
(e.g. `https://www.example.com,https://app.example.com`).

On Cloudflare Pages, bind a KV namespace named `RATE_LIMIT_KV` to the project
(Settings → Bindings → KV namespace) to enable per-IP rate limiting of
`/api/generate-worksheet` (10 requests per hour, same as the Express server).
Without the binding the function logs a warning and applies no limit. For a
stricter, edge-enforced limit, add a Cloudflare WAF rate limiting rule on the
`/api/*` path; on Vercel use a Firewall rate limiting rule.
